# Minecraft 1.16.100
## How to use 
To use it, you **need** to have a Microsoft account that own Minecraft Windows 10. This won't help you pirate the game. 

1) Download the file.
2) Uninstall your Minecraft.
2) Make sure you have developer mode activated, so you can install apps from outside the Microsoft Store.
3) Double click the .Appx and install it.
5) Launch the game.

That's it. You now have a downgraded version of Minecraft!
